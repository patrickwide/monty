Monty bytecode is a programming language that was created for the Holberton School project "Monty 0.98q" in order to teach students the basics of bytecode interpretation and stack/queue algorithms. It is a simple, stack-based language that uses a series of bytecodes, or instructions, to perform operations on a stack of integers.

The Monty bytecode interpreter reads a file containing a series of bytecodes and executes them one at a time. Each bytecode consists of a mnemonic, or word, followed by an argument. The mnemonic indicates the operation to be performed, and the argument specifies any additional information needed for the operation.

Here is an example of a simple Monty bytecode program that pushes the number 123 onto the top of the stack and then prints it:

   push 123
   pall

The Monty bytecode interpreter is designed to be simple and easy to understand, making it a useful tool for learning about the basics of bytecode interpretation and stack/queue algorithms.
